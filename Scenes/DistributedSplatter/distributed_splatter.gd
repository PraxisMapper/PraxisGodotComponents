#This is the Splatter scene, but with distributed multiplayer support.
#If another player is on the same network (perhaps easier to prove with 1 phone in 
#hotspot mode and the others connected to it's wifi point), their actions will be
#shared in realtime. If a host were to exist for this, the devices could all talk
#to that host and share info with it and out to a larger playerbase.

# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
func _ready() -> void:
	pass # Replace with function body.


# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
func _process(delta: float) -> void:
	pass
