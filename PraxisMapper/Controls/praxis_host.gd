class_name PraxisHost
# PraxisHost is a take on allowing a client device to act as a server/host for multiplayer
# games via a distributed network. A device in host mode won't play the normal game, but will
# manage and track clients in service to them. 

# Clients can communicate with each other similarly to hosts, but only on the same router.
# Hosts should be servers that can cross that boundary. Hosts will have slightly higher
# ability to validate save data, in that they'll handle more data and relay it around, but 
# clients should be able to do the same actions small-scale if they can interact with each other.

#The primary difference between Host and Client is that Host is expected to be stationary,
#and be at the same IP in the near future. Clients are expected to move and play the game, possibly 
#changing IPs multiple times even while playing. They will both have the same code available.

#Hosts: have a mostly-unchanging IP, do not play the game, 
#Clients: Can change IP frequently, are playing the game, 

#The generic packet format for this will be something like this:
#{
# dataType: "string",
# #other data entries as necessary for the dataType.
# sender: id,
# signature: sig.
#}

#TODO: simplify stuff so other games can use this without editing too much code
#That probably means a few functions that wrap some of this core behavior, that do the 
#important parts in that chain automatically.
#That makes the core look like, what?
#SendData(remote, baseObject) and ReceiveData(remote, rawData)?
#And that chain checks trust, validates/makes signatures, and converts to/from JSON
#So the actual game needs to have, somewhere, a feature list to inject, and 
#a list of functions to handle via requests. Are those in GameGlobals, or do I make those static?

#so how do I have a function be able to call this send-back? OH RIGHT, its just the return value.
#so anything that wants to call this node needs to have its own, or access to this as a global.


#TODO: May need some kind of 'pending' operations array so we can save stuff that 
#we want to do and remove it once we've gotten a response from the remote.
#TODO: set up support functions for a chain-signed ledger, since that may become a thing?
#our ledger plan will become eventually correct, mostly by ignoring people that don't agree 
#or aren't trusted, possibly with a mechanism for them to take our copy and agree with us.
#TODO: allow UI to manually add host IP
#TODO: may need to allow Windows PC users to run a host and set their location/range manually.

#TODO: I need to check if another device' external IP is the same as this one. If so, they
#need to communicate via local IP or broadcast only, not via external, because they're on
#the same router.

#TODO: Document expected usage. Possibly change name.
#Probably something like "in your loading screen, call PraxisHost.DeclareFeature(name)
#to let other clients know what you can and cannot handle on this version of the app, and 
#PraxisHost.AddNetworkFunction(name, callable) to tell the program which function to call
#for what dataType of packet received. EX: PraxisHost.AddNetworkFunction("runbattle1", RunBattle)
#would send a packet with a dataType of "runbattle1" to the RunBattle function passed in. It
#might be a good idea to have your features and your network function names line up. If your 
#function returns data, that will be sent back to the original sender, so ensure it follow the
#PraxisHost packet format, which includes at least a dataType entry to send to a network function
#on the remote device. Don't have your network function send to the remote, return the data to send."


#TODO: should this use a higher-level api? WebSockets, possibly?
#Right now this could be shoved into a global and it would work, which isnt true of the 
#SceneTree multiplayer setup. I will have to experiment and see if there's anything else
#going on for UDP issues that justify upgrading to another protocol. WebSocketPeer inherets from
#PacketPeer, so it shouldn't be TOO hard to replace PacketPeerUDP with it if needed.
